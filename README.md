# JBoss Tools LiveReload Project

# Summary

JBoss Tools LiveReload plugin support for having edits done
in eclipse to be automatically reloaded in browsers that has
livereload.js or LiveReload plugin installed.

It will also provide an optional proxy mode that will automatically inject
script at the bottom on the return html pages, so that livereload.js
is activated without having to install a browser extension nor
edit the pages/templates in the application.
