# JBoss Tools LiveReload Project

# Summary

LiveReload plugin provides a way for edits done in Eclipse to be automatically reloaded in browsers with the livereload.js or LiveReload plugin enabled.

**NOTE: This project is deprecated, and will likely be removed from JBoss Tools at some point in the future.**

It will also provide an optional proxy mode that will automatically inject
script at the bottom on the return html pages, so that livereload.js
is activated without having to install a browser extension nor
edit the pages/templates in the application.
